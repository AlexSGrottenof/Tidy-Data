# Variable Description
The values in the Tidy data are the means of the aggregate values by Subject and Activity for the variables described below.

* The variable descriptions were provided with the original dataset. As the variable names were kept in the Tidy Dataset this Code Book looks similar to the 
original Codebook.

* Subject  	Participant in the study, identified by an integer from 1 to 30
* Activity	Activity performed by the subject: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
          WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

* The remaining variable names are provided as a list. The components of the names
are explained here.
* prefix 't'   denote time
* 'f'          indicate frequency
* '-XYZ'       denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions

* Acc          signal from the accelerometer
* body         force exerted by the subject
* Gravity      force exerted by gravity
* Gyro         signal from the gyroscope
* Jerk         signals derived from body linear acceleration and angular velocity
* Mag          Magnitude  
* mean()       Mean value
* std()        Standard deviation

* Units        Angular velocity(radian/sec), forces (standard gravity unit"g"), 
             frequency(Hz)
